# Three-games-in-Android-Studio
Project for android development course

README

Author: Geraldine Marin-Zamora

This project has 3 games, Hot or Cold, Hangman, and ConnectFour. All games change background color depending on the player's turn and have quit buttons to leave at any time during the game.

The scoreboard is displayed in all activities and is stored when app is quit.

ConnectFour player must tap on desired circle and program will accept the choice if there are no grey circles below. Otherwise, the player may try again.

I affirm that I did not give or receive any unauthorized help on this project, and that all work is my own.
